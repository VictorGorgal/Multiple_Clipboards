# Multiple Clipboards

This project was developed with the necessity of parallel "ctrl+c" and "ctrl+v" in mind.

It was used a Raspberry Pi Pico, running MicroPython, together with 6 buttons, 3 independent pairs, each being a different clipboard.  
Through Serial communication, which button was pressed is sent to a Python program running in the background on the computer.  
Highly scalable algorithm, with the addition of new clipboard being done with just one line of code on the microcontroller
